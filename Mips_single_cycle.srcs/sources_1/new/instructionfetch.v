// Revision:
// Revision 0.01 - File Created
// Additional Comments: Initially, the Jump/Branch/+4 decision was done by cascaded
// 2:1 muxs. This was causing a problem as the Jump address was arriving to PCPrime
// (wire) at the same posedge clk cycle that created it. Thus the jump occured in
// the current clock cycle and not in the next clock cycle. The Branch address was
// working as intended as the branch occured in the next cycle. The reason for this
// was that the Branch address had to go through 2 2:1 muxs, and the added
// propagation delay was enough to prevent the signal from reaching PCPrime at the
// same time as the current rising clk signal. PCJump only had to go through 1 mux
// and therefore the propagation delay wasn't enough.
//
// To fix this, I combined both control signals and created a 3:1 mux, (so all 3
// signals shared the same propagation delay) and stored the result into a new
// register (PCPrimeReg). This was to ensure that the next PC address and the
// current PC address remain separated.
//
// Added signals for the registers so I could monitor them on the simulation.
//
// Added reset switch to PC and PCPrimeReg register in order to initialise a 0
// value in them during normal operation.
